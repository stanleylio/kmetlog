# Service discovery stuff
#
# To run this as a daemon:
#   python service_discovery.py
# To initiate a service search:
#   python service_discovery.py q
#
# Three jobs:
#   It responds to requests from other hosts looking for the 'kmet1' service;
#   It listens for service announcements from other hosts and maintains a list of hosts offering that service;
#   It serves that list of hosts offering the 'kmet1' service for processes on this machine (though there's
#       nothing stopping the other hosts from querying for that list).
#
# ... wouldn't need this if DNS works...
#
# Run this script directly and it would handle the query-respond as a daemon;
# Run this script with the argument 'q' and it would return the list of known hosts offering
# the 'kmet1' service.
#
# The Protocol (on UDP PORT):
# To find other hosts, broadcast the string (using topic='kmet1' as example)
#   {"service_query":"kmet1"}
# Publishers that got this message would respond with the string (using kmet-bbb as example)
#   {"hostname":"kmet-bbb","services":[["kmet1","192.168.1.109",9002]]}
# To see the list of hosts with the kmet1 service, send
#   {"get_service_listing":"kmet1"}
#
# - - - - -
# A publisher can publish multiple topics at multiple ports, and a subscriber can subscribe
# to multiple topics from multiple publishers.
# Basically N-to-N: "every host has sensor feeds that other hosts may read", and "every host
# is potentially interested in other feeds" - i.e. there's no longer fixed roles of
# "publisher" and "data logger".
#
# Yet there's still the decision to be made: after discovery, which of those am I actually
# interested in?
#
# In principle, this host does not need to maintain an up-to-date list of known hosts at all
# time - you can initiate a query broadcast when such list is needed. Small delay, small
# price to pay.
#
# The host would still need a daemon to respond to query broadcasts from other hosts.
